 The Neil Patel website annoyed me with lots of flashy popups and forced me to take an irrelevent quiz but eventually gave the app a score of 83 (great). The recommendations for improvement were:
 * Add a sitemap.xml to optimize interaction with bots
 * Add a valid SSL certificate
 * Add more words (low word count)
